Kulia is therefore not able to organize its content according to its goal and to display information more thoroughly. As the foodtruck is located in Nørresundby, outside of the city center, it may be difficult for potential cusotmers to learn about this new project.",

The targeted audience falls into specific people categories, such as outgoing people who are curious, who are willing to try something new, who are open to enjoy an alternative experience and the related environment, or simply people who have an interest in fast food due to limited time. Regarding the media usage, the targeted audience has access to smart devices which can navigate through social media and internet in general.",
            two: "Qualitative interviews are conducted to gather people’s opinion about the food trucks and to know their experience with this concept. Also, to gather insights about Argentina and its cuisine. The interview guide consists of two following research questions, based on the client brief and brainstorming: 'Food truck experience' and 'Opinions about Street food and foreign cuisine'",
            three: "Having the interviews ready, each team member make coding and thematizing of the interview to find common patterns.",

They are filled with quotes and concepts that best reflect users’ insights. The data that is most suitable for the project is placed there. That kind of visualization help to analyze the findings.",

            three: "Wireframes are created to structure the ideas. The landing page contains the header, menu teaser and event section. This is where design patterns are implemented. For instance, card design pattern is used to show the menu items, hamburger menu is used for the navigation and fat footer design for the footer section. On the menu page, all menu items are shown, as well as ingredients and short description about a specific dish.",
            four: "Based on the wireframes more detailed version prototypes can be produced. All the iterations are preceded by a user feedback, in order to implement their insights. As the colors were already given by the client, the main goal at that stage is to create a clear hierarchy and to visualize the atmosphere of the place.",
            five: "Concerning the home page, the above the fold content should give the user the idea of what the website is about and also reveal some information about the place itself. The palm and food truck svgs give the place has a loose, friendly vibe. To interact with the website, arrow and catchy slogans are added to interest the users.",
            six: "The received feedback suggest that the design is too crowded and overwhelming, therefore in the next iteration we give some whitespace and prolong the introduction - thanks to that, the design looks more clean and the content is more readable. We decide also to limit the number of colors.",
            seven: "The last feedback before the final iteration shows that the colors are not the best match for the website - a dark brown colors reminds more of a coffee shop than food truck. Also, the contrast between the brown header and white section is too much.",
            eight: "In the final version color are more toned down, illustration is simplified and shapes less abstract.",
            nine: "Through the iterations of the menu page, the goal is to display the items in most attractive way and ecourage the customers to try them. To make the design more playful and fun, svg images are created. We have however some problems with diving the items from one another and creating a clear visual hierarchy. Eventually we decide to use a card design pattern and add some background color to every menu item, which makes the information more structured.",

For instance, to add new menu items or upload the events they plan to participate in. All data are fetched through WordPress, where it is structured based on our needs for the website.",

In JavaScript, we create a function responsible for rendering the right CSS file, depending on the actual screen size. This solution has however many flaws and it cannot be the final one. The files are eventually merged, and the code is revisited and simplified. The responsiveness is obtained with a help of media queries and relative units such as view width and view height. Also, with the help of flex and grid.",
